# kumiki_rails

A Sekkei-powered specification-driven development project.

## About This Project

This project uses [Sekkei](https://github.com/yourusername/sekkei) for AI-assisted specification-driven development workflows. All features start with a specification, are broken down into testable work packages, and follow a systematic development process.

## Quick Start

### Create a New Feature

```
/sekkei.specify "Add user authentication"
```

This creates a feature specification in `sekkei-specs/###-feature-name/spec.md`.

### Generate Implementation Plan

```
/sekkei.plan
```

Creates `plan.md` with architecture decisions, technology choices, and implementation phases.

### Break Down Into Tasks

```
/sekkei.tasks
```

Generates `tasks.md` with work packages and individual task prompts.

### Implement the Feature

```
/sekkei.implement
```

Executes work packages following the Kanban workflow: planned → doing → for_review → done.

## Workflows

### Claude Code Integration

This project includes Claude Code slash commands in `.claude/commands/`:

- `/sekkei.specify` - Create feature specifications
- `/sekkei.plan` - Generate implementation plans
- `/sekkei.tasks` - Break down work into tasks
- `/sekkei.research` - Conduct technical research
- `/sekkei.implement` - Execute implementation
- `/sekkei.review` - Review completed work
- `/sekkei.accept` - Validate and merge features
- `/sekkei.constitution` - Manage project principles

### Available Scripts

**Bash scripts** (`.sekkei/scripts/bash/`):
- `setup-spec.sh` - Create new feature specification
- `setup-plan.sh` - Generate implementation plan
- `setup-tasks.sh` - Break down into work packages
- `setup-research.sh` - Set up technical research
- `setup-implement.sh` - Start implementation workflow
- `update-agent-context.sh` - Update CLAUDE.md with latest context

## Development Workflow

Sekkei follows a structured development process:

1. **Specify** → Create feature specification (WHAT and WHY)
2. **Plan** → Design architecture and implementation approach (HOW)
3. **Research** → Investigate technical options (optional, before planning)
4. **Tasks** → Break down into concrete work packages
5. **Implement** → Execute work packages with clear prompts
6. **Review** → Validate quality and correctness
7. **Accept** → Merge completed features

Each phase has clear deliverables and validation criteria.

## Contributing

All features follow the Sekkei workflow:

1. Start with `/sekkei.specify` to document the feature
2. Use `/sekkei.plan` to design the implementation
3. Run `/sekkei.tasks` to break down into work packages
4. Execute with `/sekkei.implement`
5. Review and iterate as needed
6. Merge with `/sekkei.accept`

## Project Constitution

Project-specific principles and standards are documented in `.sekkei/memory/constitution.md`. This living document defines:

- Core principles that guide all development
- Architecture standards and patterns
- Code style conventions
- Testing requirements
- Decision log with rationale

Use `/sekkei.constitution` to update as the project evolves.
